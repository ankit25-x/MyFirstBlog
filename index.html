    <h1>My Journey into Coding</h1>
    <p>They say that its not about the destination but the journey. 
    Well in my life, my destination was not defined. Frankly speaking, I was 
    walking a path decided by others and was not one of my own decisions.
    I am still on that path but something in my life has definitely changed.
    Its like you couldn't find the switch for your car headlights and suddenly something clicked!
    Well I hope it was the right switch!</p>

    <p>So how did find this switch or was it some coincidence?</p>

    <p>Coincidence or not, it was definitely destiny. Being a bachelor, I was living 
    as a paying guest with another room-mate. He was working as a front-end developer
    and I was into sales. I used to always see him leave for office, in his regular clothes coming back with
    not even a slight sign of stress. One day, I asked him how is he not tired or stressed after 
    work to which se simply replied - " its simple bro, I love what I do and I am good at it!" Being
    an engineer really intrigued me to finally look into coding and I asked him if I can still change 
    my career profile. What he said next changed my perspective forever. "You can change your
    career whenever you want in life. In the outside word degrees don't matter but your knowledge and capability do"</p>
    
    <p>I was so depressed and tired of getting sucked into a blackhole like situation thinking I would have to do this
    all my life and here was my chance. I always wanted to apply myself into something technical having done engineering.
    Long story short I never bothered to do all of this in my "golden days" I told my roomie all of this and he said - 
    "Listen, Don't worry. You can still do it". He introduced me to free code camp. I was introduced to html and CSS basics
    and I was blown away.</p>
    
    <p>Still there was one small problem and believe me when I tell you - time. The whole day when you comeback tired from
    your sales job, you don't feel like doing anything. In such a situation motivation is everything. I continued with my 
    momentum, but I couldn't see my self getting a coding job just yet. There were 2 obstacles. One, guidance from someone
    on what to study and put more emphasis on based on industry requirements. And second, recruitment -  who would take a 
    guy who's only experience is in sales? </p>
    
    <p>Again, It was the suggestion of my room-mate that changed my life. He introduced me to a person who has made the goal 
    of his life to uplift people who are stuck in a bad job and want to improve their lives. Lets just keep this kind and 
    generous person as anonymous. Currently, I have made 2 CLI apps and learnt how to use github. He has designed a series 
    of tests to clear post which I am eleigible to be trained under him to be industry ready. What's more post my training,
    I can apply to openings and hopefully achieve my goal.</p>
    
    <p>To people who have read this far, I would only say one thing to you - Never limit yourself. You can do anything you set 
    mind to. And yes I did quote eminem in the last line!</p>
